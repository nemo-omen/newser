# Newser

Newser is a pretty simple news search application that allows a user to search for news using the NewsCatcher free API.

## Features

### Autosave last article search
Newser automatically saves the last set of articles that were returned from a search. Refresh the browser and your last articles will be there.

### Bookmark
Bookmark articles to save for later. Click on the `Bookmarks` link in the header to navigate to all of your bookmarks. Save a bookmark by clicking on the bookmark buttoon in the footer of any article card. If an article is bookmarked, the icon will be a magenta color.

If an article is already bookmarked, clicking the icon will remove it from the bookmarks.

### Dark/light mode
The Newser color scheme can be changed by clicking on the icon directly underneath the search input. If you are in light mode. the icon will appear as a moon. If you're in dark mode, the icon will appear as a sun.

The color scheme will automatically set itseld depending on the browser-level or OS level user preferences as well. If you have dark mode set by default in your browser, the scheme will automatically be set to dark mode.

### Notes

I did my best to stick with the organizational approach presented in the class. Still, I feel like the project could use some serious refactoring. The code is not as well-organized as I would prefer and, given more time, I would clean the whole project up.

There are still some rough edges and small problems, but overall it achieves what I intended.
